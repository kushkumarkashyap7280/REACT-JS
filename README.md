> **Before you open any day's code, always read that day's README first!**
>
> Reading the README side by side with the code will give you a much better experience and deeper understanding of the concepts.
>
> **⚠️ Important: Do NOT push `node_modules` to GitHub!**
>
> - Always add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file.
> - I delete `node_modules` from each project to keep the repo lightweight and avoid making it bulky.
> - To run any project, go into that day's folder, run `npm install` (or `npm i`), then `npm run dev`.
> - If you see `node_modules` is missing, just install dependencies as above and everything will work!
